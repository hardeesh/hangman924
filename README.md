### The game
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Create the variables for the game - milestone_2.py
1. Define a list of possible words
2. Choose a random word from the list
3. Ask the user for an input
4. Check the input is a single character
5. Update the latest code changes to GitHub

### Check if the guessed character is in the word - milestone_3.py
1. Iteratively check if the input is a valid guess
2. Check whether the guess is in the word
3. Create functions to run the checks

### Create the Game class - milestone_4.py
1. Create the class
2. Create methods for running the checks
3. Define what happens if the letter is in the word
4. Deine what happens if the letter is not in the word

### Putting it all together - milestone_5.py
1) Code the logic of the game
