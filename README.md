## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
### The game
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Initial tasks to recap learning
milestone_1.py displays some of the tasks that were completed to ensure that I revisited some of the basics of Python Programming.
These tasks include:
1. Define a list of possible words
   Topics to remember:
   - When writing a list, ensure that each word is written in quotation marks
   - Use square brackets [ ] when writing a list
2. Choose a random word from the list
   Topics to remember:
   - Ensure that import random is written in the first line of code
   - Use random.choice to choose a random element from the list
3. Ask the user for an input
4. Check the input is a single character
   Topics to remember:
   - Use len to ensure the user only inputs one letter
   - Use str.isalpha to ensure the user only inputs alphabetical letters
5. Update the latest code changes to GitHub
